    name: "The Blair Witch Project",
    plot: "The Blair Witch Project is a unique horror film that uses the 'found footage' style to tell a scary story. It follows three filmmakers who get lost in the woods while looking for the legend of the Blair Witch. Instead of using many special effects, the movie creates fear through the atmosphere, strange noises, and what is not shown. The shaky camera and natural acting make everything feel real and help build a sense of fear and confusion.",
